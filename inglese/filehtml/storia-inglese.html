                    We are in the 1960s, when the future members of the original Pink Floyd lineup (Roger Waters, Nick Mason, Richard Wright) met at the early University of Westminster in London. During this time, Waters was residing in Cambridge, which allowed him to connect with a key figure for the band's future, Syd Barrett. David Gilmour, a student from a nearby school, had the opportunity to meet them.
                    <br><br>
                    At the University of Westminster, the future stars decided to join Sigma Six, the school band, performing interpretations of popular songs of the time suitable for entertaining youth parties. Initially, Waters played the guitar, Wright handled rhythm, and Mason played the drums. With the arrival of Klose and Barrett, Waters switched to the electric bass, and Wright to the keyboards. Wright, aspiring to improve his skills, left the architecture school to enroll in a music course, where he developed a passion for jazz and electronic music, influencing the band's future innovative style.
                    <br><br>
                    During that year, the band's name changed several times until settling on "Tea Set." However, in 1965, during a contest, Barrett noticed another band with the same name and decided to change it to Pink Floyd. In 1966, during a performance, managers Peter Jenner and Andrew King recognized the band's potential and invested in equipment, allowing Pink Floyd to make significant improvements. In 1967, they released their first single, "Arnold Layne," on March 10, and on August 4, their debut album, "The Piper at the Gates of Dawn," primarily written by Barrett and influenced by folk style.

                <p class="testo">
                    The main problem for the band was represented by Barrett's condition, who, due to drug abuse, especially LSD, tended to alienate himself during performances. Despite attempts with psychiatrist Ronald Laing, the situation did not improve. The band then decided to involve their friend David Gilmour as a second guitarist during concerts, relieving Barrett of his role. Barrett was eventually removed in 1968, leading to the departure of the managers. Steve O'Rourke took over their role.
                    <br><br>
                    The subsequent period was characterized by decent songs, interrupted by a progressive turn that led Pink Floyd to abandon the psychedelic style and embrace progressive rock. The result of this period is the renowned album "Meddle," followed by other compositions.

            <div class="box">
                <p class="testo">
                    In 1971, the progressive era gave way to the classic period, reaching its peak in 1973 with the release of their most successful album, "The Dark Side of the Moon," on March 23, selling over 45 million copies.
                    <br><br>
                    The album's cover, designed by Storm Thorgerson, became iconic in the world of rock. Another significant compilation is "A Nice Pair," which includes two albums, "The Piper at the Gates of Dawn" and "Saucerful of Secrets," with the addition of the track "Wish You Were Here." In 1978, due to the bankruptcy of a company, Pink Floyd had to leave the United Kingdom and settle in France.
                    <br><br>
                    here, the band focused on creating a new album, exploring melancholic themes of Waters' life through the metaphor of the rockstar Pink. Three successful singles emerged from this work: "Another Brick in the Wall," "Comfortably Numb," and "Don't Leave Me Now." After Waters' departure, the band continued to produce songs, reaching the present day, where, using social platforms like YouTube, they released a reissue of the track "Animals."
